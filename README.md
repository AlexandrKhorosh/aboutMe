### He mastered **HTML**, **CSS**, learned to work with **Sass** and **Less** preprocessors, as well as minimized the code and wrote very little in **JavaScript**. He wrote the code according to the BEM methodology and superficially touched **Gulp** and **Node.js** for himself to automate many tasks, such as minimifying the file when assembling the project, compressing the image without losing quality, as well as to create and launch a web server. [The portfolio on GitHub]((https://github.com/AlexandrKhorosh)) has repositories with my completed training projects.
